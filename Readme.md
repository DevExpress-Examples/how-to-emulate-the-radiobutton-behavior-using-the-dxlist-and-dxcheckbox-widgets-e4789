# How to emulate the RadioButton behavior using the dxList and dxCheckBox widgets


<p>At present, DevExteme does not provide the RadioButton widget. It is possible to introduce a similar functionality manually using the dxList and dxCheckbox. The main idea is to place the dxCheckbox to the item template and when a user checks the check box, uncheck other check boxes in your dxList. </p>
